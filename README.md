## 🛠️ Getting Started with InterviuAI

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/interviuAI.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd interviuAI
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm install
4. Set up environment variables:

- Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
- Paste the following environment variables inside it:

   ```bash

    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    INTERVIEW_QUESTION_COUNT=5

    DATABASE_URL and GEMINI_API_KEY are intentionally NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ —
    they are only ever read on the server (Server Actions), never bundled to the browser.

5. Set up the database:

- Make sure your PostgreSQL database is correctly connected and accessible via the NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIZZLE_DB_URL.
- Run the following command to set up the database:

   ```bash

    npx drizzle-kit push
6. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
- Access your app at: http://localhost:3000
